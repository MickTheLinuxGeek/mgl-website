Well here it is.  I finally built my first website, my own place on the internet.
I have always wanted to build a blog and post interesting stuff, but could never find a good way to accomplish this.  I have tried building Hugo sites before, but
it never worked out.  I tried using one of Hugo's themes, but trying to modify one of those to suit my needs turned into a nightmare.  Well, here I am again using 
Hugo to build a website and a blog, this time with the help of AI.  Starting from a blank slate or trying to use one of Hugo's themes just didn't work for me.  If I 
can get something I like to start with, then I have no problem taking off from there.  What I have so far looks good and I like it.  This is a work in progress and I'll 
be making changes as I go along.  I'll see how it goes.
