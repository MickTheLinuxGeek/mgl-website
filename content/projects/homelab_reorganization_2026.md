This is the initial phase of the 2026 homelab reorganization at MickGeekLabs.

**Phase 1:** Migrate the Jellyfin server from an HP Elitedesk 800 G3 SFF to an HP Prodesk 600 G4 mini equipped with a USB-C DAS.
**Phase 2:** Deploy a Ugreen NASync DXP4800 Plus 4-bay NAS as the primary services server.
**Phase 3:** Repurpose the DXP2800 2-bay NAS (the current services server) for a new specialized role.

Once these phases are complete, further expansion and reorganization will follow as the budget allows.
