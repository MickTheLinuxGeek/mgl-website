## Happy New Year -- 2026

Happy New Year! It has been a while since I last posted. I have been busy working on the DITS issue tracker application.

I am currently finishing the last groups of development tasks for the web application. After that, I have a list of things I need to go back and add or complete. I am hoping to have this work done by the end of January; then, it will be time for testing and fixing issues. I am looking forward to getting back to it, as I have taken a little break to work on some other things.

In the past, I have not been one for setting goals at the start of a new year, but for 2026, I figured I would try to set some. I have some ideas for the home-lab I would like to implement. It is kind of a mess right now, and I would like to get it into a more manageable state. I also have a couple of other programming projects in the beginning stages, one being a lighter TUI version of the issue tracker application; it still needs some fleshing out. I want to build upon and expand my website, and I also want to focus on continued learning. I have a stack of books to read covering topics ranging from Python programming to data science and geospatial data science. This is an area I have really slacked on lately, and I want to change that. I will have to put a lot of focus and effort into this goal.

Anyway, I think that is all for now. I wanted to get this post finished earlier, but it is already almost the end of the day. Have a great 2026—I hope you accomplish great things.

Oh! By the way, this is a new version of my website. I decided to give it a new look for 2026, and I really like it.

"What about you? Are you diving into any new programming languages or home-lab projects this year? Let me know in the comments!"
