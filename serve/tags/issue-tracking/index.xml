      <description>&lt;p&gt;One day awhile back, I was working on developing a blog application using Python and Django.  I came to a point where I needed to keep track of bugs, issues, and&#xA;items that needed research.  How was I going to do this?  I could use GitHub issues, as I keep the project in a repository.  That would work fine, but I would have to&#xA;keep switching context from my IDE to GitHub issues.  Eventually I would need to start tracking issues on GitHub, but I felt where I was at in the development process,&#xA;that was not the way I wanted to go.  So, what I ended up doing was creating a project.its file and dumped issues and whatever else that needed researched into&#xA;it.  Although this worked, the file ended up being an unformatted mess and difficult to track issues, especially if there were a lot.  What was I going to do?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
