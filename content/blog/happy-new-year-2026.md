## Happy New Year -- 2026

Happy New Year!  It has been awhile since I last posted.  I have been busily working on the DITS issue tracker application.
I am currently working on the last groups of development tasks for the web application.  After that, I have a list of things
I need to go back and add and/or complete.  I am hoping to have this work done by the end of January; Then It will be testing
and fixing issues.  I am looking forward to getting back to it, as I have taken a little break from it and working on some 
other things.

In the past I have not been one for setting goals at the start of a new year, but this year, in 2026, I figured I would try 
and set some.  I have some ideas for the home-lab I would like to implement.  It is kind of a mess right now, and I 
would like to have it in a more manageable state.  I also have a couple of other programming projects that are in the beginning
stages, one being a lighter, TUI version of the issue tracker application; It still needs a some flushing out.  I want to build 
upon and expand my website.  Then there is the continuing learning I would like to accomplish this year.  I have a stack of books
that I need to read.  They cover topics ranging from Python programming, data science, and geospatial data science.  This I an 
area I have really slacked on, and I do not like that.  This one I will have to put a lot of focus and effort into.

Anyway, I think that is all for now.  I wanted to get this post finished and out earlier, but here it is almost the end of the day.
Have a great year in 2026 and accomplish tremendously.

Oh!  By the way, this a new version of my website.  I decided to give it a new look for 2026.  I really like it.

"What about you? Are you diving into any new programming languages or home-lab projects this year? Let me know in the comments!"
