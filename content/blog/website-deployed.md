Website deployed!  I finally have my own website; My own space on the web.  For the last few years, I have wanted to build a website to showcase
the projects I am working on, and have a place to blog.  Like I said in my first post, I tried to use Hugo to build a website before, but always 
struggled with the templates and how all files fit together.  I tried a couple different times, and I still have the GitHub repositories from those
attempts.  I tried to modify one of Hugo's templates to fit my use case, but could not achieve something I liked, and starting from a blank canvas 
was not going to work either, as I am not that creative with these kinds of things.  

Some time passes, and it is getting to the point I really need to have a website.  I have projects in the works that would benefit from it.  Well,
where do I go and how do I start?  After some thought, I decided to draft the help of AI to get me started.  Once I have something I like and 
can work with, I am good to go.  I had an Idea.  What I did was, I took some information from my GitHub profile, as I think I have a pretty good one,
and fed it to Gemini AI, along with a prompt explaining what I wanted.  To my amazement, I liked what it gave me; A good place to start, just 
what I needed.  I took that HTML and CSS and had Gemini convert it so I could use it with Hugo.  I massaged it a bit more, and this is what I have
today.  I am actually having fun doing this now.

The website is a work in progress.  I already have a growing list of improvements for the first update, and I can not wait to get started working
on them.  If you happen to read this, drop me message on Mastodon or Bluesky or even an email.  The links are at the bottom of the home page.  Hope 
to here from you.  Over and out.
