      <title>DITS Origin</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One day awhile back, I was working on developing a blog application using Python and Django.  I came to a point where I needed to keep track of bugs, issues, and&#xA;items that needed research.  How was I going to do this?  I could use GitHub issues, as I keep the project in a repository.  That would work fine, but I would have to&#xA;keep switching context from my IDE to GitHub issues.  Eventually I would need to start tracking issues on GitHub, but I felt where I was at in the development process,&#xA;that was not the way I wanted to go.  So, what I ended up doing was creating a project.its file and dumped issues and whatever else that needed researched into&#xA;it.  Although this worked, the file ended up being an unformatted mess and difficult to track issues, especially if there were a lot.  What was I going to do?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Website deployed!  I finally have my own website; My own space on the web.  For the last few years, I have wanted to build a website to showcase&#xA;the projects I am working on, and have a place to blog.  Like I said in my first post, I tried to use Hugo to build a website before, but always&#xA;struggled with the templates and how all files fit together.  I tried a couple different times, and I still have the GitHub repositories from those&#xA;attempts.  I tried to modify one of Hugo&amp;rsquo;s templates to fit my use case, but could not achieve something I liked, and starting from a blank canvas&#xA;was not going to work either, as I am not that creative with these kinds of things.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;DITS (Developer Issue Tracking System) is a purpose-built issue tracker designed exclusively for individual software developers. It eliminates the &amp;ldquo;collaboration tax&amp;rdquo; of&#xA;team-oriented tools by providing friction-less issue capture, sub-100ms interactions, and deep bidirectional Git integration, offering a keyboard-first,&#xA;flow-state-optimized experience across web, desktop, mobile, and IDE platforms while ensuring complete data portability and user ownership.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Creating A Website</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well here it is.  I finally built my first website, my own place on the internet.&#xA;I have always wanted to build a blog and post interesting stuff, but could never find a good way to accomplish this.  I have tried building Hugo sites before, but&#xA;it never worked out.  I tried using one of Hugo&amp;rsquo;s themes, but trying to modify one of those to suit my needs turned into a nightmare.  Well, here I am again using&#xA;Hugo to build a website and a blog, this time with the help of AI.  Starting from a blank slate or trying to use one of Hugo&amp;rsquo;s themes just didn&amp;rsquo;t work for me.  If I&#xA;can get something I like to start with, then I have no problem taking off from there.  What I have so far looks good and I like it.  This is a work in progress and I&amp;rsquo;ll&#xA;be making changes as I go along.  I&amp;rsquo;ll see how it goes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
