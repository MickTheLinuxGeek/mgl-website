One day awhile back, I was working on developing a blog application using Python and Django.  I came to a point where I needed to keep track of bugs, issues, and just
things that needed research.  How was I going to do this?  I could use GitHub issues as I keep the project in a repository.  That would work fine, but I would have to 
keep switching context from my IDE to GitHub issues.  Eventually I would need to start tracking issues on GitHub, but I felt where I was at in the development process,
that was not the way I wanted to go.  So, what I ended up doing was creating a project.its file and dump issues and whatever other things that needed researched into it.
Although this worked ok, the file ended up being an unformatted mess and difficult to track issues, expecially if there were a lot.  What was I going to do?

I did some research to see if I could find an open source solution, but all I could find was orginazational/team project planning and problem tracking applications.
Those are great if you are working in that kind of enviornment, but too heavy for just a single developer or a small team of two or three.  This is were I came up with 
the idea to write/create my own issue tracking application.  It will be able to track issues/problems or anything else for that matter for multiple projects and for 
multiple areas.  So, what the user will be able to do is track "things" for let's say work, personal, or learning, etc., and have multiple projects under those areas.

My application is called DITS, Developer Issue Tracking System.  I am in the early development stages of the project.  I have most of the core backend and a good
amount of the frontend/web application finished, but still have a lot of work ahead.  I work on this project a few hours a day or when time permits; It's an 
ambishish and interesting project.  I'll post more as I make progress.
