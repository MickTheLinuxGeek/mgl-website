## NAME
mickgeeklabs - personal portal and technical lab logs of Michael Biel

## SYNOPSIS
**mickgeeklabs** [--about] [--projects] [--feed] [--search]

## DESCRIPTION
**mickgeeklabs** is a custom-built static site designed to simulate an industrial laboratory console. It serves as a central hub for documenting engineering projects, infrastructure automation, and home lab research.

The interface utilizes a low-light, high-contrast palette optimized for technical deep-dives and late-night tinkering.

## FOCUS AREAS
**Automation**
       Eliminating manual toil. Using Python, Ansible, and Terraform to define environments as code.

**Infrastructure**
       Personal data ownership via self-hosted services. Running K8s, Proxmox, and specialized hardware.

**Open Source**
       Contributing to the ecosystem. Relying on and patching the tools that power the lab.

## TECHNICAL STACK
The site runs on a modern, high-efficiency stack:

**Hugo**
       Static site generator for rapid content delivery.

**Tailwind CSS v4**
       Utility-first styling for a precise industrial aesthetic.

**Pagefind**
       High-performance client-side search indexing.

**GitHub Actions**
       CI/CD pipelines for automated site building and deployment.
