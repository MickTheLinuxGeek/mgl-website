DITS (Developer Issue Tracking System) is a purpose-built issue tracker designed exclusively for individual software developers. It eliminates the "collaboration tax" of 
team-oriented tools by providing friction-less issue capture, sub-100ms interactions, and deep bidirectional Git integration, offering a keyboard-first, 
flow-state-optimized experience across web, desktop, mobile, and IDE platforms while ensuring complete data portability and user ownership.
